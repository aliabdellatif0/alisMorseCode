#Translator

This is my translator...

A MORSE code translator where input taken in English will be outputed in MORSE code whereby letters are separated by a space and actual spaces will be represented by a '/'. 

For any inputs given that are not letters and numbers an error will be produced as this syntax is invalid. This includes full stops as this would confuse and defeat the purpose of MORSE code.
